Job Scheduler Microservice (FastAPI + APScheduler + SQLite)

Overview

This project is a modular backend microservice for scheduling and managing automated jobs, built with FastAPI for REST APIs and APScheduler for task scheduling.
It stores job configurations in a SQLite database, supports immediate job execution, as well as scheduled recurring tasks using cron or interval triggers.

For demonstration, the scheduled job computes and outputs the first 10 prime numbers.
The architecture is designed using MVC structure and follows SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability.

Features
- Create scheduled jobs with cron, interval, or once execution modes
- List all jobs with details (name, schedule, status, last run, result)
- Get job by ID
- Update job parameters and reschedule
- Delete a job
- Trigger job immediately
- Store and retrieve job results
- OpenAPI documentation auto-generated by FastAPI
- Modular MVC code organization for production readiness
- Dummy Job used in this porject is to simply print the First 10 Prime Numbers

Tech Stack
- FastAPI – API framework with Pydantic validation & OpenAPI docs
- APScheduler – Background scheduler for interval/cron jobs
- SQLite – Local persistence (easily replaceable with PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- SQLAlchemy – ORM for DB access
- Pydantic – Data validation & serialization
- Uvicorn – Lightning-fast ASGI server

API Endpoints
1. List Jobs
    GET /jobs

2. Get Job By ID
    GET /jobs/{id}

3. Create Job
    POST /jobs
    Example payload (runs every Monday at 6 AM):
        {
        "name": "Print 10 Primes Weekly",
        "description": "Print the first 10 prime numbers every Monday at 6am",
        "interval": "cron",
        "schedule_params": {
          "day_of_week": "mon",
          "hour": 6,
          "minute": 0
        }
      }

4. Update Job
    PUT /jobs/{id}

5. Delete Job
    DELETE /jobs/{id}

6. Run Job Immediately
    POST /jobs/{id}/run

How the Scheduler Works
- Job creation saves configuration (interval type + params) in the DB.
- At startup, APScheduler loads and starts; each new job with schedule params is added to APScheduler.
- Triggers supported:
  * cron (e.g., every Monday 6 AM)
  * interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)
  * once (specific date/time)
- On execution:
  * Computes first 10 primes.
  * Saves result, updates last_run_at and status in DB.
  * GET endpoints fetch these updated values.
 
Local Setup
